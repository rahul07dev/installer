# Testing the AES-GCM Encryption System

This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for the AES-GCM asset encryption system.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### 1. Build Process Testing

**Test the encryption task:**
```bash
# Clean and build to test encryption
./gradlew clean
./gradlew encryptAssets
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

**Verify encrypted assets:**
- Check `app/build/encrypted-assets/` directory exists
- Verify `app.apk.enc` file is created
- Confirm file size is reasonable (original + IV + GCM tag)

### 2. Asset Verification

**Check encrypted file format:**
```bash
# Navigate to encrypted assets directory
cd app/build/encrypted-assets/

# Check file exists and has reasonable size
ls -la app.apk.enc

# Verify it's not the original APK (should be binary encrypted data)
file app.apk.enc
```

### 3. Runtime Testing

**Install and test the app:**
1. Install the APK on a device/emulator
2. Grant installation permissions when prompted
3. Click "Update" button
4. Verify the app can decrypt and install the embedded APK

**Check logs for encryption/decryption:**
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "(AssetEncryption|AppInstaller|AssetEncryptionTask)"
```

### 4. Security Verification

**Verify assets are encrypted in final APK:**
1. Extract the built APK: `unzip app-debug.apk`
2. Check `assets/` folder contains only `.enc` files
3. Verify original files are not present
4. Confirm encrypted files cannot be opened directly

### 5. Error Handling Testing

**Test various failure scenarios:**
- Remove the encrypted asset and test error handling
- Corrupt the encrypted file and verify authentication failure
- Test with insufficient permissions

## üîç Expected Results

### Successful Build Output:
```
AssetEncryptionTask: Starting encryption process
Input directory: /path/to/app/src/main/assets
Output directory: /path/to/app/build/encrypted-assets
Encrypting with AES-GCM: app.apk
Successfully encrypted app.apk (X -> Y bytes)
AssetEncryptionTask: Encryption process completed
```

### Successful Runtime Logs:
```
D/AssetEncryption: Attempting to read encrypted asset: app.apk.enc
D/AssetEncryption: Read XXXX bytes of encrypted data
D/AppInstaller: Successfully decrypted APK, size: XXXX bytes
I/AppInstaller: Installing APK: com.rto1p8.app, current version: 0, new version: X
```

### Security Verification:
- Original `app.apk` should NOT be in final APK assets
- Only `app.apk.enc` should be present
- Encrypted file should be unreadable binary data
- File size should be: original_size + 12 (IV) + 16 (GCM tag)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Build Issues:
- **"Input directory does not exist"**: Normal if no assets folder exists
- **Encryption fails**: Check file permissions and available disk space
- **Task not running**: Verify buildSrc is properly configured

### Runtime Issues:
- **"Encrypted APK file not found"**: Check if encryption task ran successfully
- **"Decryption failed"**: Verify encryption key consistency
- **"Invalid encrypted data format"**: Check file wasn't corrupted during build

### Performance Issues:
- Large APK files may take longer to encrypt/decrypt
- Monitor memory usage during decryption
- Consider chunked processing for very large files

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The encryption system is working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
2. ‚úÖ Encrypted assets are generated in `build/encrypted-assets/`
3. ‚úÖ Final APK contains only `.enc` files in assets
4. ‚úÖ App successfully decrypts and installs embedded APK
5. ‚úÖ No original unencrypted files are accessible
6. ‚úÖ Tampering with encrypted files causes authentication failure
7. ‚úÖ App functions exactly as before encryption was added

## üîê Security Notes

- The current implementation uses a hardcoded key for demonstration
- For production, consider using NDK or device-specific key derivation
- AES-GCM provides both encryption and authentication
- Random IVs ensure each encryption is unique
- GCM authentication prevents tampering

This encryption system provides strong protection for your APK assets while maintaining full functionality of your application.
